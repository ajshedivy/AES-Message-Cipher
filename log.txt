###### Welcome to the Message Encrypter/ Decrypter ######

This message encoder is based on the 'AES encryption algorithm', or 'Advanced Encryption Standard'.
AES is a fast and secure form of encryption that can keep your data safe. AES is a subset of the
Rijindael block cipher that was developed by two belgian cryptographers. The US government uses this
algorithm for securing sensitve, but unclassified information.

The following program demonstrates its simple and efficient use.
To start, select command [1] to encrypt a message
